# C-simulation-for-hydrodynamic-and-heat-transfer-calculations-in-Slug-flow-condition
Thorough this simulation, a transient hydrodynamic-heat transfer model for gas-liquid slug flow in pipe has been developed. Please go to Report.pdf for a complete manual. This is an ongoing research, therefore only .cpp files will be shared in GitHub.
